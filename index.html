  <h1>Welcome to my very basic website!</h1>

  <h2>Who am I, you may ask? And why am I making this website?</h2>
    <p> I am Sophia Martin and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I live in Madison and I am a student studying Communication Arts with a focus in radio, tv, and film and I am getting my certificate in Digital Studies. I am making this website for my LIS 351 class.<p> 
    <p> I was born in Beverly Hills, California, but I have lived in Madison Wisconsin for the last three years since I started college. If I could live anywhere else in the world I would live in Tokyo, Paris, or London. I really enjoy watching movies and television shows, doing pilates, and going to the beach, but the lake will suffice. In high school, I was very dedicated to broadcast journalism, and if you would like to see some of my interviews, please visit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXwuvYdl6oNM22TyULlEHA/videos?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank">Sophia's YouTube Homepage</a></p>

  <h2>What can you expect from this website?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>movies I love</li>
      <li>favorite restaurants in Madison</li>
      <li>introducing you to my friends</li>
    </ul>
