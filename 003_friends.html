  <h1>A little insight into me and my friends</h1>

  <h2>Who are these people?</h2>
    <p> I wanted share a little insight into my life by showing you all of my friends.<p> 
    <p> (from left to right)The first photo is of me and my freshman year roommate, and current roommate Molly and probably my forever roommate.We Travelled to Chicago for the weekend to see Chicago's famous "Bean". The Next photo is of my boyfriend Lucas and I. We have been dating for almost 2 years and he is a nice midwestern boy! Boy oh boy, where do I even start, these are my best friends from childhood, Lauren, Lauren, and Abby. We call ourselves Do the Roar. The next photo is me and my best friend Kathryn who I met through school. She is the life of the party. Next photo is of me and Esme. She's more than my friend because she is literally my sister. I have known this girl since the day I was born. The next photo is of my friend Katie and I. We have also known each other FOREVER, and I am still trying to convince her to come to Madison for graduate school. The two last photos are more of my friends that I have made in Madison. I love each of these people so much... but Lucas the most!</p>
